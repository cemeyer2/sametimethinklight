By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

See the&#xA;    GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;    along with this program.

By contrast,&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xA;know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&#xA;authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xA;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xA;protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xA;on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xA;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xA;form of a work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xA;Source.&#xA;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xA;same work.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xA;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xA;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xA;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xA;measures.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&#xA;users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xA;technological measures.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xA;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xA;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xA;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xA;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xA;modification has been made.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xA;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xA;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xA;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xA;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xA;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xA;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xA;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xA;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xA;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xA;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xA;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xA;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xA;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xA;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xA;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xA;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xA;material under section 10.&#xA;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xA;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xA;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xA;licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xA;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xA;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xA;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xA;patent against the party.&#xA;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xA;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xA;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&#xA;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xA;combination as such.&#xA;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xA;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xA;later version.&#xA;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xA;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xA;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xA;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
